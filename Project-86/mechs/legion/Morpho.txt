	The Morpho is the Railgun Type Legion unit which was used to destroy the Republic's Gran Mur and minefields. The unit was the host for the neural network of Kiriya Nouzen which was eliminated by the Nordlicht Squadron at the end of Run Through The Battlefront. The Morpho can only be deployed in certain situations, primarily in a battlefield installed with railway tracks.
