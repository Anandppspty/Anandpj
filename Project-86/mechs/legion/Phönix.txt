	The Phönix is a High-Mobility Type Legion unit excelling in stealth and close-quarters combat. The Phönix was first discovered by the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package during the Charité Underground Labyrinth Operation. Presumably, it is one of the Legion units not originally developed by the Giadian Empire.
