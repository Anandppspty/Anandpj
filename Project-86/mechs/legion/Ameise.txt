	The Ameise is the Scout Type Legion unit. It is functionally the Legion equivalent of an infantryman. Its name is derived from the German word for ant. As one of the most common types of Legion, it uses specialized sensors to perform scouting and reconnaissance for larger, less perceptive Legion units such as the Löwe and Dinosauria. The Ameise also provides forward observation for the Legion's Skorpion and Morpho artillery units, pinpointing targets for barrages. Additionally, it is also used as an anti-personnel unit.
