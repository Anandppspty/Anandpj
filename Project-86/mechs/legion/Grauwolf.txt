	The Grauwolf is a Dragoon Type Legion unit specialized for close combat. Its name is German for gray wolf. The two high frequency blades allow it to tear apart even heavily armored enemies with ease. The 76mm rockets in it's back-mounted launcher are also capable of piercing armor. However, the need for high mobility to close in with the enemy required the sacrifice of the Grauwolf's armor. As a result, it can be destroyed even by the heavy machine guns of the M1A4 Juggernaut.
