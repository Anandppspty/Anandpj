	The Löwe is a Tank Type Legion unit. Its name is derived from the German word for lion. It is equipped with a 120 mm smoothbore cannon that is more than twice the size of the 57 mm cannon on the M1A4 Juggernaut, and is heavily armored. It specializes in decimation of targets that leverages its enormous size, and excels in bombardment warfare with overwhelming firepower that crushes everything in its path. It also works as an efficient anti-personnel unit. The Löwe, however, has low sensor capabilities, so it needs to be fed information beforehand by the Scout-type Ameise when it is about to engage a target.
