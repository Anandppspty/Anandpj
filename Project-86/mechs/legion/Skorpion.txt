	The Skorpion is the Long-Range Gunner Type Legion unit. The Skorpion provides artillery fire support from behind the front lines, and as such require spotters to fire accurately. Due to the fact that this unit is not designed to be positioned along the frontline, it has nearly no armor and has extremely poor mobility. The reduction of armor makes it extremely light weighed comparing to other Legions, which allows it to be launched and deployed by the electromagnetic catapult on the Zentaur.
