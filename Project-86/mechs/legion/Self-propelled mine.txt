	The Self-Propelled Mine is a disposable Antipersonnel Type Legion that is used as a suicide-bomb unit. A weapon radically different from all other types of legion, the Self-Propelled Mine is usually mistaken for an injured soldier and will attempt to cling onto humans and Feldreﬂ alike then self destruct. The Warhead located in their abdominal cavity is capable of completely vaporizing a human or taking down a Feldreﬂ along with it's processor. The Self-Propelled Mine is the only Legion capable of producing audible human sounds crying "Save me" and "Mommy" to attract enemy soldiers. A child model produced in greater numbers early in the war was used to devastating effect as civilians still occupied the battlefield claiming the lives of many soldiers. After the events of the CharitÈ Operation, Self-Propelled Mines are capable of greater strategic thought. In one case ignoring Spearhead Squadron to cause a collapse of the facility they were in. A later model encountered in the Raid on Dragon Fang Mountain is seen to be able to deploy a chaff smokescreen disrupting optical sensors and radar.
