	The M101 Barrett or Scavenger is a support drone designed to accompany the M1A4 Juggernaut and its successor—the XM2 Reginleif. It is equipped with two high-operation crane arms and one large container mount, and has a loading capacity of over 10 tons. An M101 Barrett and a Scavenger are practically identical; the former was built by San Magnolia's RMI, while the latter was reverse engineered from the Barrett by Giad's WHM.
