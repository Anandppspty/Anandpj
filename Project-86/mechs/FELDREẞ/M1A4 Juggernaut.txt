	The M1A4 Juggernaut is the sole Feldreß of the Republic of San Magnolia, manufactured by Republic Military Industries. While developed as an answer to the hordes of advanced drones of the Giadian Empire's Legion, the Juggernaut is markedly inferior to the various types of Legion in firepower, protection, and mobility. Its classification as an unmanned weapon is an ostensible one, as the machines are piloted by the Eighty-Six, who are deemed non-humans under the Republic's discriminatory policies.
