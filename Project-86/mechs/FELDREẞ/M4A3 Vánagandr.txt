	The M4A3 Vánagandr is the staple Feldreß of the Federacy. The third-generation Vánagandr is said to be superior to the Ameise and Grauwolf of the Legion, though slightly inferior to the Löwe. Its design features a tandem cockpit, manned with a driver and a gunner/unit-commander. All crew members must wear an armored exoskeleton when operating the M4A3.
