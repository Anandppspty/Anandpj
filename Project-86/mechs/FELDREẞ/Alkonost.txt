	The Alkonost is the semiautonomous Feldreﬂ that comprise the bulk of the United Kingdom's forces. The Alkonost is specifically designed to be piloted by Sirins, but can be controlled by humans to a much lesser efficiency. It is designed for combat on snowy fields, on icy surfaces and cold regions. The legs are equipped with talons that stab into the terrain for easier movement. It is armed with a 105mm gun/launcher which can fire ATGM - Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and HE - High Explosive shells. Its secondary armament is a coaxial 14mm heavy machine gun to the right side of the main gun.
