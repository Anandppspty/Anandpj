	The XM2 Reginleif is an experimental third-generation Feldreﬂ of the Federal Republic of Giad. It was designed by Lieutenant Colonel Grethe Wenzel and inspired by the Republic of San Magnolia's M1A4 Juggernaut. It is built for high-mobility attacks as part of a mobile defense strategy. The Reginleif is capable of reaching an off-road cruising speed of over 100 km/h.
