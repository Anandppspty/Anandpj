Background: As the youngest of the known Spearhead Squadron members, Kurena was born in Republic Year 352 on May 6th. She and her family lived in the Republic city of Charité before the war began. After the announcement of Executive Order 6609 in RY 358, Kurena and her family were sent to a concentration camp. As the Eighty-Six were waiting to enter the camps, the soldiers on guard detail, mostly conscripted criminals and thugs due to the shortage of manpower, decide to have some target practice. The soldiers randomly selected Kurena's parents from the crowd and shot them repeatedly for amusement. Kurena and her older sister were forced to watch as their parents were cruelly murdered. Kurena's memories of that night developed into hatred of any Albas and was further reinforced by the conscription of her sister, her last remaining family member, dying during her service. In 363 RY, Kurena was conscripted at the age of 11 and sent to the battlefront. She would join Shin's squadron two years later. While serving under Shin, she repeatedly saw Shin's mercy killings of mortally wounded squadron members. She was fascinated by his kindness, for his willingness to be taking on the responsibility of letting others have a quick death and for his tradition of carrying the names of the fallen in their memory. Kurena wished to be able to have the same strength and fortitude as Shin so as to be able to give the same kindness to him as he did others. This motivated her to hone her shooting to an exceptional level. However, she eventually realized that she could not match Shin's unique abilities and that she would likely die long before him. Thus, she gave up trying.
