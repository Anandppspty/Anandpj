Background: Theo was born on April 20th 351 in the Republic of San Magnolia. His ancestors migrated from a southern nation called Elektra two hundred years ago. Much like the other Colorata, he and his family were sent to the internment camps of the Eighty-Sixth Sector and forced to fight the Legion. Theo holds a grudge against most Alba, but is willing to accept that there are some honorable ones due to a past experience in his first squadron. His first squadron was lead by an Alabaster former soldier from the decimated Republic Armed Forces. Theo and the rest of his squadron hated their leader, believing him to be a self-righteous pig that could retreat to the Eighty-Five Sectors once things went south. He didn't run away however; the leader died in a sortie where he refused to retreat to allow the other Processors to escape. The dying squadron leader's final words to Theo had a profound impact on him; Theo adopted the leader's Personal Name and Mark of Laughing Fox. Theo and Kurena would join Shin and Raiden's squadron in RY 366. A year later in April, they would be assigned to the First Ward and form the Spearhead Squadron of RY 367. Abilities
