Background: Kaie was born in the Republic of San Magnolia on April 7th RY 349. Like the other Colorata, she was sent to the internment camps of the Eighty-Sixth Sector when she was young. As an Orienta—a rarer race in the sector—she was heavily discriminated against by her fellow Eighty-Six. She was in her fourth year as a Processor when she was transferred into the Spearhead Squadron with Haruto in RY 367.
