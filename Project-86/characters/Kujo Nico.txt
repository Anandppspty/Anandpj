Background: On April 1st RY 367, he was assigned to the Spearhead Squadron in the First Ward. The Spearhead Squadron had their photos taken to update the Processors’ personnel files, holding a board with their internment numbers as if it were a mugshot. He was amazed that Shin had lodged a nut and 
bolt at the graffiti image of Saint Magnolia, while indirectly intimidating the Republic officer. Kujo started a countdown to the end of his service on the next day, much to Lev's disapproval. Kujo would continue to update the countdown on the hangar's black board until his death. The message stopped at the countdown of 128 days. On April 5th, he and the Spearhead Squadron held a cherry blossom party to celebrate their formation squad. They watched the shooting stars together. On May 12th, Kujo was seen changing the countdown message. He and the Spearhead Squadron ate at the canteen. He played soccer with his Squadron, and he kicked the ball at Lev's head. On May 18th, he was stargazing and night sky watching with Fido. His last mission was on May 22nd RY 367. He was mortally wounded by a Self-Propelled Mine. One had latched onto Kujo, who’d mistaken it for an injured soldier. It had been a night-time battle; a mission to rescue another unit. Kujo was euthanized by Shin. He was the third casualty of the Spearhead Squadron.
