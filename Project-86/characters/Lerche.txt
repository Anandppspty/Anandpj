Background: Lerche was created as the first Sirin, a weapon with the intended use of being the United Kingdom's spear against the Legion. It began when Lerchenlied had died when she accompanied Vika to his first battlefield. Once again, just like his mother, Vika attempted to preserve her into an artificial intelligence using his Amethystus abilities. He succeeded in using Lerchenlied's brain structure to create Lerche in SY 2144, and in the process invented the base process of creating the Sirins.
