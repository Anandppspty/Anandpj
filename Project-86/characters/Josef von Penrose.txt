Background: Josef was a neuroscientist who was friends with Shin's father when they were studying in university. During the oppression of the Republic against Eighty-Six, he provided shelter for Shin's family until his daughter, Annette, opposed. He was later invited by the government to join the development of the Para-RAID device. After he found out about the cruel experiments that have been conducted during the development, he committed suicide by using the Para-RAID device to overload his brain.
