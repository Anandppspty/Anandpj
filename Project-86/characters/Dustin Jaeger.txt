Background: Dustin is a fast learner, having been a valedictorian before volunteering. While initially clumsy and nauseated by the horrible sights of war, he adapted to the battlefield rather quickly. Dustin was also quick to see the hypocrisy of the Republic due to his circumstances. As a Celena, he was spared from the atrocities carried out on the Eighty-Six despite having been born in the Empire. Such hypocrisy was a major factor in his enlistment. He is also compassionate. He prefers not to burden Shin any further than they already do and gave up his blanket for Anju when they were trapped in the mountain shack. He was also particularly attentive to Anju's scars. Dustin is moderately capable of reading the room, but somehow manages to make situations more awkward. He easily admits his desire to see Anju in a bikini without realizing that Shin (and by extension, everyone on comms) had been eavesdropping. He also walks in on a touching Shin and Lena moment after getting lost, making the embarrassment worse by telling them to not mind him and continue.
