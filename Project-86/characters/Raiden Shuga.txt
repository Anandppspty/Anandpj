Background: Raiden was born on August 25th Republic Year 351; he was originally from somewhere in the Republic's Twenty-Third Sector. He is the only Spearhead Squadron member able to remember their birthday, as he was spared from being exiled to the Eighty-Sixth Sector at the outbreak of war. An elderly Alba woman hid him and several other Colorata children in an abandoned boarding school in the Twenty-Third Sector. For five years, Raiden and the others managed to avoid being sent to the concentration camps. However, they were eventually discovered when someone exposed them to the Republic. Despite the pleas and protests of their Alba caretaker, the Colorata children were taken away to the Eighty-Sixth Sector. After being conscripted as a Processor, Raiden was placed in a squadron with the other children who had been sheltered. After a series of battles, Raiden was the sole survivor of the group who had been hidden in the Eighty-Five Sectors. His squadron was disbanded and reassigned, leading Raiden to be assigned to the the squadron Shin commanded at the time. While Raiden initially was at odds with the seemingly aloof Shin, the two gradually became close friends. Raiden eventually won the role of vice-commander and served as Shin's right-hand man. The two served together from then on, joined the next year by Kurena and Theo. Three years after meeting Shin, they would be sent to the First Ward and form the Spearhead Squadron.
