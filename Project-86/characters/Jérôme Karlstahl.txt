Background: He is a cynic and nihilist. Jérôme recognized the evil and ignorance of the Republic, and of how the Republic had thrown away its ideals. Instead of trying to change that, he simply followed the will of the people while growing more and more jaded. He believes it is the military job to listen to the will of the citizens. However he harbours bitterness and disgust to the populace. He was one of the few survivors of the Republic military from before the first invasion of the Legion.
