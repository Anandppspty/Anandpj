Background: Anju was born on October 2nd Republic Year 351 to two Alba Republic citizens. Once the Special Wartime Peace Preservation Act was issued, Anju and her mother were sent to the Eighty-Sixth Sector due to their blue eyes inherited from a distant ancestor. Anju was physically abused by the other Eighty-Six in the internment camps. As someone with mostly Alba heritage, she was a perfect outlet for the others to lash out on. The abusers carved into her back a derogatory inscription, ever since she wore her hair long to hide the scar. Once she had enlisted, she was assigned into a squadron with Daiya Irma. The two would stick with each other for the entirety of their service, developing feelings for each other in the process. After some time, Anju and Daiya joined the Claymore Squadron along with Shin, Raiden, Theo, and Kurena. The six were then sent to the First Ward's Spearhead Squadron four years into Anju's service in RY 367.
