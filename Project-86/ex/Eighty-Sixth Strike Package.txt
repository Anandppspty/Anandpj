	The Strike Package was created following the elimination of the Morpho and the relief of San Magnolia by the Nordlicht Squadron. Due to the unique circumstances, personnel, and equipment of the Nordlicht Squadron, as well as the influx of new Eighty-Six joining the Federacy's war effort, they were not integrated into the regular forces. Thus, the Strike Package was established as a unit of foreign soldiers focusing on mobile deployment, equipped with the highly successful XM2 Reginleif.
