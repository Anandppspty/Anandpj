	Spearhead Squadron is a multi-generational unit of Processors from all over the Eastern Front who managed to survive until near the end of their service. Because of the skills the members acquired at this time, they are generally regarded as the Republic's most elite unit in the East, matching Sledgehammer Squadron in the North, Razor Edge Squadron in the South, and Longbow Squadron in the West. However, this was only the squadron's public image. In reality, it was founded as part of the Republic's secret initiative to purge the Eighty-Six. While promising to reinstate their citizenships once their terms came to an end, the Republic's leadership had no intention of actually letting them reach their deadlines, both due to their prejudices and to erase evidence of their human-rights violations. To this end, as their service went on, they would re-assign them to units with higher casualty rates. Spearhead Squadron was the final link in this chain: a suicide squad designed to purge its members. If all else failed, the surviving members would simply be sent on a one-way mission into Legion territory one month before the end of the unit's operation time.
