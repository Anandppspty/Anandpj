Relatives: Ernst Zimmerman (Adoptive Father)

Relationships: -

Occupation: Processor

Military Rank: Second Lieutenant

Background: Anju was born on October 2nd Republic Year 351 to two Alba Republic citizens. Once the Special Wartime Peace Preservation Act was issued, Anju and her mother were sent to the Eighty-Sixth Sector due to their blue eyes inherited from a distant ancestor. Anju was physically abused by the other Eighty-Six in the internment camps. As someone with mostly Alba heritage, she was a perfect outlet for the others to lash out on. The abusers carved into her back a derogatory inscription, ever since she wore her hair long to hide the scar. Once she had enlisted, she was assigned into a squadron with Daiya Irma. The two would stick with each other for the entirety of their service, developing feelings for each other in the process. After some time, Anju and Daiya joined the Claymore Squadron along with Shin, Raiden, Theo, and Kurena. The six were then sent to the First Ward's Spearhead Squadron four years into Anju's service in RY 367.

Occupation: Processor

Military Rank: Second Lieutenent

Background: Dustin is a fast learner, having been a valedictorian before volunteering. While initially clumsy and nauseated by the horrible sights of war, he adapted to the battlefield rather quickly. Dustin was also quick to see the hypocrisy of the Republic due to his circumstances. As a Celena, he was spared from the atrocities carried out on the Eighty-Six despite having been born in the Empire. Such hypocrisy was a major factor in his enlistment. He is also compassionate. He prefers not to burden Shin any further than they already do and gave up his blanket for Anju when they were trapped in the mountain shack. He was also particularly attentive to Anju's scars. Dustin is moderately capable of reading the room, but somehow manages to make situations more awkward. He easily admits his desire to see Anju in a bikini without realizing that Shin (and by extension, everyone on comms) had been eavesdropping. He also walks in on a touching Shin and Lena moment after getting lost, making the embarrassment worse by telling them to not mind him and continue.

That was until Rita was bullied for being friends with a Colorata boy. She asked her father to kick Shin's family out of their home; as a result, Shin's family was sent to the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Annette was a friend of Lena's since secondary school. She skipped a grade along with Lena, and thus she is Lena's only friend who is the same age. After her father was killed during the testing of the Para-RAID device, she took on her father's role as a developer. Although it was stated to be an accident, her father took his own life. He was unable to bear the guilt of betraying the Nouzens and engaging in human experimentation. Annette also bears regrets of betraying her childhood friend.

Military Rank: Ensign

Background: On April 1st RY 367, he was assigned to the Spearhead Squadron in the First Ward. The Spearhead Squadron had their photos taken to update the Processors’ personnel files, holding a board with their internment numbers as if it were a mugshot. He was amazed that Shin had lodged a nut and 
bolt at the graffiti image of Saint Magnolia, while indirectly intimidating the Republic officer. Kujo started a countdown to the end of his service on the next day, much to Lev's disapproval. Kujo would continue to update the countdown on the hangar's black board until his death. The message stopped at the countdown of 128 days. On April 5th, he and the Spearhead Squadron held a cherry blossom party to celebrate their formation squad. They watched the shooting stars together. On May 12th, Kujo was seen changing the countdown message. He and the Spearhead Squadron ate at the canteen. He played soccer with his Squadron, and he kicked the ball at Lev's head. On May 18th, he was stargazing and night sky watching with Fido. His last mission was on May 22nd RY 367. He was mortally wounded by a Self-Propelled Mine. One had latched onto Kujo, who’d mistaken it for an injured soldier. It had been a night-time battle; a mission to rescue another unit. Kujo was euthanized by Shin. He was the third casualty of the Spearhead Squadron.

Occupation: Processor

Military Rank: Second Lieutenant

Background: As the youngest of the known Spearhead Squadron members, Kurena was born in Republic Year 352 on May 6th. She and her family lived in the Republic city of Charité before the war began. After the announcement of Executive Order 6609 in RY 358, Kurena and her family were sent to a concentration camp. As the Eighty-Six were waiting to enter the camps, the soldiers on guard detail, mostly conscripted criminals and thugs due to the shortage of manpower, decide to have some target practice. The soldiers randomly selected Kurena's parents from the crowd and shot them repeatedly for amusement. Kurena and her older sister were forced to watch as their parents were cruelly murdered. Kurena's memories of that night developed into hatred of any Albas and was further reinforced by the conscription of her sister, her last remaining family member, dying during her service. In 363 RY, Kurena was conscripted at the age of 11 and sent to the battlefront. She would join Shin's squadron two years later. While serving under Shin, she repeatedly saw Shin's mercy killings of mortally wounded squadron members. She was fascinated by his kindness, for his willingness to be taking on the responsibility of letting others have a quick death and for his tradition of carrying the names of the fallen in their memory. Kurena wished to be able to have the same strength and fortitude as Shin so as to be able to give the same kindness to him as he did others. This motivated her to hone her shooting to an exceptional level. However, she eventually realized that she could not match Shin's unique abilities and that she would likely die long before him. Thus, she gave up trying.

Background: Raiden was born on August 25th Republic Year 351; he was originally from somewhere in the Republic's Twenty-Third Sector. He is the only Spearhead Squadron member able to remember their birthday, as he was spared from being exiled to the Eighty-Sixth Sector at the outbreak of war. An elderly Alba woman hid him and several other Colorata children in an abandoned boarding school in the Twenty-Third Sector. For five years, Raiden and the others managed to avoid being sent to the concentration camps. However, they were eventually discovered when someone exposed them to the Republic. Despite the pleas and protests of their Alba caretaker, the Colorata children were taken away to the Eighty-Sixth Sector. After being conscripted as a Processor, Raiden was placed in a squadron with the other children who had been sheltered. After a series of battles, Raiden was the sole survivor of the group who had been hidden in the Eighty-Five Sectors. His squadron was disbanded and reassigned, leading Raiden to be assigned to the the squadron Shin commanded at the time. While Raiden initially was at odds with the seemingly aloof Shin, the two gradually became close friends. Raiden eventually won the role of vice-commander and served as Shin's right-hand man. The two served together from then on, joined the next year by Kurena and Theo. Three years after meeting Shin, they would be sent to the First Ward and form the Spearhead Squadron.

	       Fido (Pet)

Occupation: Processor

Military Rank: Captain

Background: Born on May 19th in Republic Year 351, Shin lived with his family in the First Sector of the Republic before the war with the Giadian Empire began. It is implied he lived a sheltered life, surrounded by "only kindness and affection". He also appeared to have developed his extrasensory ability early on, hearing "voices that spoke without words" from his family. He would often play with the daughter of his father's colleague, Henrietta von Penrose, whom Shin called Rita. Shin and his family were forced to relocate to an internment camp when the war began due to the Republic's discriminatory policies. Shin's father was first to enlist in the Republic military, accepting the Republic's promise that Shin and the rest of his family would have their rights restored in exchange for military service. Despite this, the Republic does not uphold its promise. Upon delivering the news of Shin's father's death, it informs Shin's mother that the military service was in exchange for only one person's citizenship. Continuing to trust the Republic, Shin's mother also enlists to protect her sons, leaving eight-year-old Shin and his eighteen-year-old brother Shourei in the care of an Adularia priest, a friend of the Nouzens who had resisted the Republic's policies and remained in the village-turned-internment-camp's church. Shortly afterward, Rei receives notice of his mother's death on the battlefield and an enlistment form for him, proving the Republic's promise to be a lie. Shin, to whom the concept of death was not yet comprehensible, implores Rei to explain why their mother would not be returning. Shin's pleas caused the grieving and frustrated Rei to snap and choke Shin in a fit of violent rage. Rei brings Shin to the brink of death before the priest intervenes and resuscitates him. Shin is left with a jagged scar around his neck as a reminder of his brother's hatred. The near-death experience also opens Shin's telepathic ability to a broader range of human consciousnesses, including those of the Legion, by temporarily experiencing the post-mortem collective consciousness of humanity. Rei avoids Shin after the incident and refuses to say farewell or even glance at Shin when he enlists and leaves Shin behind with the priest. Four years after Rei's enlistment, Shin hears his brother's voice among the laments of the Legion and realizes that Rei is dead. On that day, Shin enlists with the military and becomes a Processor.

Background: Rei was the eldest son of Reisha and Yuuna Nouzen. He was sent to the Eighty-Sixth Sector along with his family soon after the war broke out. His father soon enlisted to fight for their rights, followed by his mother once Reisha died in combat. The absence of their parents left Rei and Shin in the care of a sympathetic Adularia priest. Later, he would also receive news of his mother's death. Due to the stress he accrued in the internment camps from his parent's deaths and imminent conscription, he snapped and irrationally took out his frustrations on Shin by strangling him. He was stopped by their caretaker, deeply regretting his actions. He left for the front lines before he could apologize to Shin. One night when he was on patrol, he came across a young Vladilena Milizé, who was taken by her father to see the injustices brought upon the Eighty-Six. Their helicopter had been shot by a Stachelschwein and was forced to land, leaving them vulnerable to an attack from a nearby Ameise. He took the only survivor, Lena, to his base and sent her back to inside the Gran Mur. Four years after his conscription, Rei was killed in action and assimilated as a Legion Shepherd.

Much like the other Colorata, he and his family were sent to the internment camps of the Eighty-Sixth Sector and forced to fight the Legion. Theo holds a grudge against most Alba, but is willing to accept that there are some honorable ones due to a past experience in his first squadron. His first squadron was lead by an Alabaster former soldier from the decimated Republic Armed Forces. Theo and the rest of his squadron hated their leader, believing him to be a self-righteous pig that could retreat to the Eighty-Five Sectors once things went south. He didn't run away however; the leader died in a sortie where he refused to retreat to allow the other Processors to escape. The dying squadron leader's final words to Theo had a profound impact on him; Theo adopted the leader's Personal Name and Mark of Laughing Fox. Theo and Kurena would join Shin and Raiden's squadron in RY 366. A year later in April, they would be assigned to the First Ward and form the Spearhead Squadron of RY 367.

They took a flight to the frontlines but was shot down by Legion's anti-aircraft batteries. He died in the incident but his daughter survived.

Background: Vika was born as the current generation's Amethystus, succeeding Svetlana Idinarohk. As an Amethystus, he was granted an Extrasensory perception which augmented his intellect and creativity. His mother passed away shortly after giving birth to him. When he was five years old, he desired to meet her. Thus, using his abilities as an Amethystus, he devoted his time to bringing her back to life. In the end, he deemed his work to be a failure. Soon after, the Kingdom became aware of his actions and he was stripped of his succession rights for desecrating his mother's corpse. He hadn't given up however; he uploaded all of his research to the public network, including an AI based on his mother's brain. Through uploading his data on the net, he was contacted by Major Zelene Birkenbaum of the Giadian Empire. Zelene recognized his work and used the Mariana Model AI he developed as the basis for the Legion. After war broke out with the Empire, many criticized and blamed Vika for the conflict. In order to combat the Legion, he created the Sirins, Artificial Fairies made from the brain structures of deceased combatants. These Sirins pilot the semi-autonomous Alkonosts and would make up fifty percent of Vika's 1st Armored Corps. Lerche, one of the Sirins, serves as his personal attendant and retainer. His actions gained him unsavory monikers within the United Kingdom, such as "The King of Corpses" and "The Serpent of Shackles and Decay". He would eventually be sent to command the southern front, waging war with the Legion nested in the Dragon Corpse Mountain Range.

Age: 18

Gender: Female

Height: 160 cm

Eyes: Silver

Hair: Silver

Relatives: Vaclav Milizé (Father)
     	   Margareta Milizé (Mother)
           Jérôme Karlstahl (Uncle/Family Friend)

Occupation: Handler

Military Rank: Colonel
     
     
Background: Lena was born into the former noble household of Milizé. After an encounter with the Eighty-Six outside the Eighty-Five Sectors when she was 10, Lena dedicated herself to becoming a Handler to assist the Eighty-Six on the frontlines. Her determination resulted in her skipping multiple grades, graduating at the top of her class, and becoming a major at the young age of 16. In the military, she has a reputation for effectively leading the Juggernaut squadrons. She has excellent tactical ability and can analyze combat data to determine the Legion's reinforcement rates. Lena exhibits a disregard for social opinions she deems immoral or useless. Despite taunts and jeers from other Handlers who dislike her close relationship with the Processors under her command due to their belief that they are traitorous sub-humans, Lena maintains her daily communications and puts in an effort to develop closer bonds with her squadrons. She remains steadfast in her opinion that the Eighty-Six can no longer be viewed as traitors due to the Giadian Empire having assumed to have fallen. Her mother's focus on social status and bloodlines, as well as the insistence—that, as the daughter of the Milizé family, Lena should resign from the army and marry another noble—are disdainful to Lena. Lena believes that the war is far more important than trivialities regarding marriage and social standing. Such ignorance towards the war from citizens of the Republic annoys Lena, who has witnessed the cruelty that allows the people of the Eighty-Five Sectors to maintain their lifestyle. Lena's sheltered upbringing and her isolation from her peers due to her rapid advancement to become a Handler have resulted in her being naïve. She believes that she can spout her outlandish ideals to the Republic without the fear of her punishment. Lena can also be authoritative when necessary and can use unscrupulous methods—such as guilt-tripping, bribing, and using physical threats—to achieve an objective. Though she is educated in social etiquette, she lacks friends besides Annette because she has outstripped all other peers in terms of education. At the same time, her noble lifestyle gives her no chance to learn basic skills such as sewing.

Occupation: Researcher (Former)
	    Millitary Officer (Former)
	    Legion Shepherd

Military Rank: Major

Background: Zelene was acquainted with Shin's father—Reisha Nouzen—as fellow researchers. Zelene used the Mariana Model AI developed by Viktor Idinarohk in tandem with the Alliance's superior Feldreß technology in order to create the Legion. She began developing the Legion when her older brother lost his life; a friendly aircraft accidently shot him down. She became reclusive after the event, Vika himself stated that she was a witch which cursed the world. Zelene's personal beliefs and experiences would shape how the Legion would operate. An example would be that the Legion could not develop its own weaponized aerial units, as she had a vehement hatred for aerial combat following her brother's death. Zelene was fully committed to making the Legion a reality, her fury only strengthened by her limited lifespan. She would apparently pass away from disease shortly before the first series of Ameise was produced. Neither her body or death certificate was ever found, due to assimilating with the Legion herself as the Merciless Queen.

Federal Republic of Giad, GIAD,REPUBLIC OF GIAD, REPUBLIC GIAD, FEDERAL REPUBLIC

	The Federacy is a country that was created after downfall of the Giadian Empire and the country which gave the Spearhead Squadron asylum after their escape from the Republic. Its capital city is Sankt Jeder.

Flag - The national symbol of Giad is a two-headed eagle, which can be found on the nation's flag and coat of arms. "Glory to the two-headed eagle" is a common salute amongst the Federacy's military.

Ethnicities - As a former empire, the Federal Republic of Giad is ethnically and racially diverse. While the groups that dominated the region were the Rubela and the Aquila, other races were not prohibited from holding high positions in society, such as noble status. The Rantz Clan was an example of Alba nobility within the old empire. The nobility which sided with the Federacy during the revolution, while stripped of their taxation rights, still played a key role in the nation. The Onyx Clans still served as military leaders and nobles with large production companies were the backbone of the war effort. Minor nobles without much contribution to society were less fortunate, often ostracized by the commonfolk. While the Federacy maintained the tolerance shown in its Imperial days, it was not perfect in its equality. The old warrior-class slaves of the Vargus were denied citizenship into the new nation, due to their stigma as untamed savages.

Language - Giad's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. Due to the diversity present in the nation, other languages and writing scripts are used along side the official language by certain minorities, such as a Japanese-like script seen in the borderlands of the old Imperial territories. While they speak the same language as San Magnolia, Roa Gracia, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.

Founding - After the Empire's declaration of war against its neighboring nations, a revolution against the Empire's government broke out. Defeating the Empire and deposing the royal family, the revolutionaries created a new republic that incorporated all the former states of the Empire. The new government was led by the revolutionary leader Ernst Zimmerman, who became interim president. Despite the victory, the newly founded Federacy was forced to continue facing the Legion due to the refusal of the Empire's military to surrender. The stubborn imperial defense resulted in no officer alive that was of high enough rank to call off the Legion assaults. Since the end of the revolution, the Federacy has been slowly retaking the territory lost to the Legion, though at a terrible cost in lives and material. Up until the arrival of several soldiers of the Spearhead Squadron from the Republic of San Magnolia, the Federacy had had little contact with neighboring nations, though the destruction of the Empire had already been detected by at least the Republic. A later offensive would allow for communications to be opened with the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia and the Alliance of Wald.

Military – The Federacy's military does not enforce conscription; instead, there are a number of incentive programs in order to ensure they were constantly supplied with fresh personnel during the war with the Legion. One such program eased the entry-barrier of becoming a commissioned officer; instead of requiring a higher education, only the minimal secondary education was required along with a special training program. These officers would then be required to obtain higher education throughout their military career.

Trivia - Giad is heavily inspired by Germany in various stages of its history, the Empire being inspired by Germany's many empires (the Holy Roman Empire, German Empire, and to an extent the Austro-Hungarian Empire) while the Federal Republic was inspired by the Federal Republic of Germany. The two-headed eagle may be a reference to the Reichsadler, a prominent symbol of Germany and Austria-Hungary. The symbol is still used to this day by Germany under the name of the Bundesadler.

Giadian Empire, Empire , Giadian

	The Giadian Empire also referred to as the Empire of Giad or Former Empire of Giad, was a technologically superior power to the east of the Republic of San Magnolia that unleashed the Legion, the world's first autonomous combat system, against all neighboring countries in Republic Year 358. The inability of other countries to make any contact with the Giadian government has given rise to the theory that the Legion went rogue four years before the war started and overran the Giadian Empire before expanding outward.

Flag - The national symbol of Giad is a two-headed eagle, which can be found on the nation's flag and coat of arms. This symbol did not change following the transition to democracy.

Ethnicities - The Giadian Empire was ethnically and racially diverse. While the groups that dominated the region were the Rubela and the Aquila, other races were not prohibited from holding high positions in society, such as noble status. The Rantz Clan was an example of Alba nobility within the empire. The highest of the nobles however belonged solely to the esper races of the Onyx and Pyrope respectively. The Onyx and Pyrope nobles were in constant friction with each other, and maintaining racial purity within these races was seen as the utmost importance. Thus, mixing Pyrope and Onyx heritage was seen as taboo, save for the royal family which was required to have mixed Onyx and Pyrope heritage. It was due to this taboo that the union between Reisha Nouzen and Yuuna Maika was not blessed, and they were exiled by their respective families. While the Empire did not heavily discriminate based on race, they did discriminate based on class, as seen in the warrior-slaves of the Vargus.

Language - Giad's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. Due to the diversity present in the nation, other languages and writing scripts are used along side the official language by certain minorities, such as a Japanese-like script seen in the borderlands of the old Imperial territories.[2][3] While they speak the same language as San Magnolia, Roa Gracia, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.

History – For the last 200 years prior to the Empire's fall, the royal family were reduced to puppets to be controlled by the high nobility. The Giadian Empire created the Legion by combining an AI invented by the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia and mechanical technology invented by the Alliance of Wald. In SY 2139, the Empire declared war on its neighboring countries and sent the Legion to invade them.

Trivia - Giad is heavily inspired by Germany in various stages of its history, the Empire being inspired by Germany's many empires (the Holy Roman Empire, German Empire, and to an extent the Austro-Hungarian Empire) while the Federal Republic was inspired by the Federal Republic of Germany. The two-headed eagle may be a reference to the Reichsadler, a prominent symbol of Germany and Austria-Hungary. The symbol is still used to this day by Germany under the name of the Bundesadler.

Republic of San Magnolia, SAN MAGNOLIA, SANMAGNOLIA

	The Republic is a country located on the western edge of the continent and was the first nation to transition towards democracy after a brutal revolution. Its capital city is Liberté et Égalité.

Flag - The Republic of San Magnolia's "five-hued" flag consists of the country's crest imposed on five stripes, each a different color: blue, red, white, black, and yellow. Each color represents one of the Republic's main moral principles: freedom, equality, brotherhood, justice, and nobility. The flag drawn on a barrack wall in the Spearhead Squadron's base is reversed vertically and horizontally, which Lena attributes to the Republic's sins against the Eighty-Six: oppression, discrimination, intolerance, atrocity, and vulgarity.

Ethnicities - The Republic initially prided itself on being a nation of diverse cultures accepting to all different races. While the open immigration policies meant many different ethnic groups, collectively called the Colorata, settled within its borders, the Republic's population remained majority Alba. Immigrants also seemed to have some difficulty in upward mobility in social classes as few of the Colorata lived in upper class districts of the Republic's capital even before the outbreak of war. The Colorata families that did live in these districts likely were of noble lineage, such as that of Shinei Nouzen's. The presence of long lines of nobility in the upper class three hundred years after the fall of the monarchy, even of smaller lines like that of Vladilena Milizé, may also be a hint that the class society of the country has not changed as much as the Republic would like to think. As of modern times, the Alba rule the nation while the Colorata are treated as no more than livestock.

Language - San Magnolia's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. They write in the standard Latin script and are not taught other scripts such as a Japanese-like script seen in the borderlands of the old Imperial territories. While they speak the same language as Giad, Roa Gracia, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.

Founding - The Republic of San Magnolia was once a monarchy. This kingdom ruled over the land's native people, the Alba, and a subset of Alba known as Celena were its nobility. Over three hundred years ago, in Republic Year 1 (Stellar Year 1782), the monarchy was toppled in a democratic revolution and the Republic, the world's first modern democracy, was founded to replace it. The revolution was led by a woman who would later be called San Magnolia, whose martyrdom resulted in her becoming the namesake of the Republic.

Military – The Republic lagged behind other countries in many fields, including the military. While most countries on the continent had already adopted Feldreß into their armed forces, the Republic Armed Forces still relied on traditional land vehicles. When the war against the Giadian Empire began, the Republic Armed Forces were completely wiped out within weeks. Consequently, the government decided to impose extreme, racist measures to rebuild its military, by stripping their Colorata populations of their citizenship, relocating them to internment camps and forcing them to fight the war on the behalf of the Alba population.

Equipment - M1A4 Juggernaut
			M101 Barrett/Scavenger

Trivia - The area of the Republic and the Eighty-Sixth Sector combined is approximately 132,603 km2.This would be nearly equivalent to the size of England. The Republic of San Magnolia has clear similarities to several republics such as France, with the capital being named Liberté et Égalité, which is taken from the French national motto "Liberté, égalité, fraternité." The United States is also alluded to as the Wartime Peace Preservation Act, Presidential Order #6609 is a reference to Executive Order 9066. Asato also clearly indicates Nazi Germany (which itself was the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise to power) and the Final Solution as a template for the Republic's atrocities. Magnolia flowers, the namesake of the Republic of San Magnolia, are also the state flower of many states in the American South and is the national flower of North Korea. A possible reference to the historical use of slavery of the South and the authoritarian regime of North Korea.

United Kingdom of Roa Gracia, UNITED KINGDOM, ROA GRACIA, ROAGRACIA

	The United Kingdom is the last surviving despotic monarchy on the continent, located in the Dragon Corpse Mountain Range. It is ruled by the Idinarohk dynasty and its capital is Arcs Styrie.

Flag - The nation's coat of arms consists of two unicorns flanking a shield and crown. The unicorn is the national symbol of Roa Gracia, while the crown would represent the Idinarohk dynasty.

Ethnicities - The nation's principal racial group are the Viola, which make up the middle and noble classes. The working class is comprised of serfs of various races from conquered territories. Despite calling them serfs, living conditions for them are not terrible. The classes are free to mingle and there is rarely unrest between them. There are cases of fairly high ranking positions at the royal palace filled with those of the serf class, examples include an Emeraud Chamberlain and the fifth prince's milk sister.

Language - Roa Gracia's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. Due to the diversity present in the nation, other languages are spoken along side or in place of the official language by those of the serf class. While they speak the same language as San Magnolia, Giad, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.

Military – In the United Kingdom, the military has—more often than not—been the domain of the nobility. The Viola are obligated to defend the country and enlist in wartime, while the other races fulfil their obligation to the country through production work. In recent times, however, more serfs have been encouraged to volunteer due to a lack of manpower. While they mostly understood it was necessary, some of the Viola opposed the introduction of serfs into the military, claiming that defending the nation was solely their right and obligation. Unlike the Vargus of the Federacy, the serfs are allowed to enter officer academies and have—on paper—the same privileges as their Viola compatriots. In practice, there is a clear difference in rank and station between the Viola veterans and the greenhorn serfs. Aside from human combatants, the United Kingdom fields a force of artificial intelligence known as the Sirins, which comprise of roughly half of the United Kingdom's armored forces. As for their equipment, the United Kingdom specifically designs their Feldreß with cold temperatures in mind. Both of their mainstay FeldreB are designed for winter warfare, optimizing for mobility on snow and ice. The Southern Front of the nation was led by the fifth prince Viktor Idinarohk and his 1st Armored Corps. Following the success of the Dragon Fang Mountain Operation and the expulsion of the Legion from the plains connecting the United Kingdom with its collaborating nations, Viktor Idinarohk and his unit was sent as the nation's representatives for the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package.
